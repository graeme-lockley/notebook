- AI agents analyzing the codebase
- Architects reviewing the design
- Technical leadership

**Key Sections for Quick Reference:**

- Core Components ‚Üí Understanding major services
- Design Decisions ‚Üí Understanding "why"
- Interface Design ‚Üí Understanding contracts
- Future Recommendations ‚Üí Planning next steps

### üìã Other Documents

- **server.md** - Server implementation details
- **PRD_ObservableHQ_Clone.md** - Product requirements
- **observablehq_clone_sveltekit_lookfirst_prompt_v3.md** - Initial prompt
- **Phase1_TaskList.md** - Implementation task list

## Quick Start for New Developers

1. **Start Here:** Read Executive Summary in ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Understand Layers:** Review "Current Architecture" section
3. **Study Core Components:** Focus on NotebookProjectionManager
4. **Learn Patterns:** Review "Design Decisions & Rationale"
5. **Check Tests:** See "Testing Strategy" section

## Quick Start for AI Agents

When analyzing this codebase:

1. **Context:** Event-sourced CQRS architecture with lazy loading
2. **Key Pattern:** NotebookProjectionManager is the heart of the system
3. **State Management:** Unified projection architecture (single source of truth)
4. **Domain Purity:** Domain layer is pure (no infrastructure dependencies)
5. **Command Flow:** Route ‚Üí NotebookCommandService ‚Üí CommandHandler ‚Üí EventStore ‚Üí EventBus ‚Üí Projectors

## Architecture Highlights

### ‚úÖ What's Excellent

- **Event Sourcing** - Complete audit trail
- **Lazy Loading** - 99.5% memory savings for inactive notebooks
- **Reference Counting** - Automatic projection lifecycle
- **Domain Purity** - 100% pure domain layer
- **Clean Architecture** - 93/100 score
- **ISP Compliance** - Focused interfaces (CellRead/Write)

### üìä Key Metrics

- Architecture Score: 93/100
- Test Coverage: 168 tests passing
- Dead Code Removed: ~1,300 lines
- Memory Efficiency: 99.5% improvement
- Grace Period: 60 seconds

### üèóÔ∏è Major Components

1. **NotebookProjectionManager** - Projection lifecycle management
2. **NotebookCommandService** - Centralized command execution
3. **PerNotebookReadModel** - Per-notebook cell storage
4. **NotebookEventFactory** - Stateless event creation
5. **Command Handlers** - Use case implementation
6. **Projectors** - Event ‚Üí Read Model updates

## Documentation History

### October 10, 2025 - Consolidation

All architecture documentation from the project root was consolidated into `ARCHITECTURE.md`. This provides:

- Single source of truth
- Chronological evolution
- Complete rationale for all decisions
- Comprehensive reference for developers and AI

**Source Files Consolidated:**

- ARCHITECTURAL_ANALYSIS.md
- LAZY_PROJECTION_SUMMARY.md
- INTERFACE_ANALYSIS.md
- ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
- INTERFACE_CLEANUP.md
- CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md

## Maintenance

### When to Update ARCHITECTURE.md

- **Major architectural changes** - Add to "Architectural Evolution"
- **New components** - Add to "Core Components"
- **Design decisions** - Add to "Design Decisions & Rationale"
- **Interface changes** - Update "Interface Design"
- **Performance changes** - Update "Performance & Scalability"

### Documentation Standards

1. Keep chronological history in "Architectural Evolution"
2. Update "Current Architecture" for structural changes
3. Add rationale for all design decisions
4. Include code examples for clarity
5. Update test statistics as needed

## Contact

For questions about architecture:

- Review ARCHITECTURE.md first
- Check "Design Decisions & Rationale" for "why"
- Check "Future Recommendations" for planned changes
